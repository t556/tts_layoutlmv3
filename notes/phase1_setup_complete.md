# Phase 1 Setup Complete

## Date: July 6, 2024
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully created organized experiment environment for all 5 math equation conversion models with individual directories and documentation.

## Completed Tasks

### Directory Structure Creation
- Created 5 individual experiment directories:
  - `plurimath_experiment/` (Priority 1)
  - `mathml_to_latex_experiment/` (Priority 2)
  - `unicode_math_experiment/` (Priority 3)
  - `unicode2latex_experiment/` (Priority 4)
  - `pandoc_experiment/` (Priority 5)

### Standardized Subdirectory Structure
Each experiment directory contains:
- `data/` - For sample equations and test cases
- `results/` - For conversion outputs and evaluation metrics
- `config/` - For configuration files and environment setup
- `README.md` - Individual experiment documentation

### Documentation Created
- Individual README files for each experiment with:
  - Overview and priority level
  - Installation requirements
  - Test plan outline
  - Success criteria
- Master experiment tracker (`experiment_tracker.md`)
- Updated progress log with current status

## Next Phase: Individual Model Testing
**Priority Order**:
1. Plurimath (Ruby gem, â‰¥98% accuracy claim)
2. MathML to LaTeX (npm package, 97-99% accuracy)
3. Unicode Math (Python/Rust)
4. Unicode2LaTeX (Python)
5. Pandoc (Document-level conversion)

## Environment Requirements Identified
- Ruby environment for Plurimath
- Node.js environment for MathML to LaTeX
- Python environment for Unicode Math and Unicode2LaTeX
- Pandoc + Haskell for Pandoc experiment

## Success Criteria Established
- Token accuracy >95%
- Processing speed <5 seconds per page
- Valid LaTeX output format
- Consistent and reliable conversion

## Notes
- All directories are ready for individual model installation and testing
- Sample equations available in `experiments/data/sample_equations.md`
- Testing framework available in `experiments/test_framework.py`
- Ready to begin with Plurimath as highest priority model
