# Progress Log - Math Equation Conversion Research

## Session 1: Initial Setup (Current)
**Date**: Current session
**Status**: In Progress

### Completed
- [x] Created experiment roadmap with clear phases
- [x] Established organized directory structure
- [x] Defined evaluation metrics and success criteria
- [x] Created sample equation dataset (manual extraction)
- [x] Built testing framework with placeholder implementations

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Plurimath Testing (COMPLETED)
**Completed**:
1. ✅ Manually extract sample equations from test PDFs (completed)
2. ✅ Set up evaluation framework (completed)
3. ✅ Create individual experiment directories for each model (completed)
4. ✅ Plurimath testing (Model A) - COMPLETED

**Results Summary**:
- Plurimath: 100% success rate, 44% accuracy, ~0.4s per equation
- Framework enhanced with accuracy calculation and LaTeX validation
- Ground truth established for 15 test equations

**Next Priority**: Phase 2 - mathml-to-latex testing (Model B)

### Experiment Directory Structure Created
- `plurimath_experiment/` - Priority 1 (Ruby gem, ≥98% accuracy)
- `mathml_to_latex_experiment/` - Priority 2 (npm package, 97-99% accuracy)
- `unicode_math_experiment/` - Priority 3 (Python/Rust)
- `unicode2latex_experiment/` - Priority 4 (Python)
- `pandoc_experiment/` - Priority 5 (Pandoc + filter)

Each directory contains:
- `data/` - Sample equations and test cases
- `results/` - Conversion outputs and evaluation metrics
- `config/` - Configuration files and environment setup
- `README.md` - Individual experiment documentation

### Test Files Available
- `Sources/How To Prove It.pdf` (59KB)
- `Sources/Whittley_IBM_Paper.pdf` (220KB)

### Model Testing Priority
1. **Plurimath 0.9+** (Ruby) - Highest accuracy claim (≥98%)
2. **mathml-to-latex v1.5.0** (npm) - Lightweight JS parser (97-99%)
3. **unicode-math** (Python/Rust) - UnicodeMath to LaTeX
4. **unicode2latex** (Python) - Bidirectional mapping
5. **Pandoc + filter** - Document-level conversion

### Notes
- Focus on MVP requirements: >95% accuracy, <5s processing time
- Single page processing assumption
- LaTeX output format required
- Need to extract diverse equation types from test PDFs
