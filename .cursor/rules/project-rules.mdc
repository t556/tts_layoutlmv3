Take a paced approach to our experiments.

Ensure consistency across code and documents.

At the conclusion of a phase or troubleshooting session, we should add a labeled entry to a 'notes' directory/markdown file. 

We should document our work/progress in a concise and more formal/academic tone.

absolutely no emojis in any code/text/documentation

Experimental/test/scrap work should be put in a scrap directory. 

we should keep the project organized. Once we agree and finalize a piece of code or script we can add it to the correct directory/root folder.

We need to be able to trace our progress and where we are.

We also should keep an updated markdown file so that when I switch to different prompts, the new agent has an idea of where we left off and how we can continue.

The project is using a machine with the following hardware:

AMD 9950X3d Processor, 64GB DDR5 RAM
Nvidia RTX 5090.

The Cuda/packages should all be compatible with the RTX 5090.

Ubuntu 22.04 OS
